# Discord OwO Ticket Notify

## Author

**Creator:** lethinh26

## Introduction

Discord OwO Ticket Notify is a self-bot that monitors the `#seller-ads` channel in the Support OwO server for stock-related messages. If someone posts a message indicating they are selling a ticket, the bot extracts relevant stock information and stores it in a MongoDB database. This allows for real-time tracking of ticket availability.

**Important Note:** This code has been intentionally restricted to minimize the risk of being detected by Discord. Since it is a self-bot, it only runs and logs notifications in the console. However, self-bots violate Discord’s Terms of Service, which can lead to account termination. If you want to unlock the full potential of this bot, consider using the dedicated bot version that I have prepared: [Discord_OwO_Ticket_Notify_Bot](https://github.com/lethinh26/Discord_OwO_Ticket_Notify_Bot).
